---

## **🔴 Critical Issues - RESOLVED**

### **1. Performance Budget Math Error** ✅
**Problem**: Budgets summed to 3.5ms but claimed 2ms compliance  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Clarified that 2ms is **BD DevTools operations only**
- Other addons have independent performance budgets
- Created detailed BD DevTools budget breakdown:
  - EventBus Coordination: 0.4ms
  - Validation Engine: 0.3ms
  - Index/Search Operations: 0.5ms
  - UI Updates: 0.3ms
  - Configuration Management: 0.1ms
  - Performance Monitoring: 0.2ms
  - Buffer: 0.2ms
  - **Total: 2.0ms** ✅

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_MASTER_PLAN.md`

### **2. EventBus/Signal Visualizer Circular Dependency** ✅
**Problem**: Mutual monitoring created initialization deadlock risk  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Documented 4-phase initialization sequence:
  1. Bootstrap: EventBus in minimal mode
  2. Visualizer Init: Signal Visualizer connects
  3. Full Coordination: EventBus enables full monitoring
  4. Safeguard: Bootstrap fallback if Visualizer fails

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_MASTER_PLAN.md`

### **3. Hop 1.1 Too Ambitious** ✅
**Problem**: Single hop included 6 major deliverables (violated CTS)  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Split into 3 focused hops:
  - **Hop 1.1a**: Plugin Bootstrap & EventBus Core (minimal viable)
  - **Hop 1.1b**: Configuration & Logging Foundation
  - **Hop 1.1c**: Validation Engine & Test Templates
- Each hop has explicit non-goals to prevent scope creep

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_PHASE_1_HOPS.md`

---

## **🟡 Medium Priority Issues - RESOLVED**

### **4. MCP Integration Status Unclear** ✅
**Problem**: MCP mentioned in requirements but not in hop plans  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Documented MCP in Phase 5 (intentionally deferred)
- Added rationale for deferral:
  - Core systems need to be proven first
  - Better understanding of external tool needs
  - Reduced complexity in early phases
  - Focus on immediate development acceleration

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_MASTER_PLAN.md`

### **5. Rust Integration Criteria Undefined** ✅
**Problem**: Plans said "use Rust when needed" with no criteria  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive decision framework:
  - **Performance Thresholds**: >5ms execution, >10,000 items, O(n²) complexity
  - **When to Use Rust**: Specific criteria with examples
  - **When GDScript Sufficient**: Small datasets, UI ops, simple operations
  - **Implementation Strategy**: Profile first, incremental adoption
  - **Validation Checklist**: 6-point decision checklist

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_MASTER_PLAN.md`

### **6. Template Analysis Time Estimates Missing** ✅
**Problem**: Phase 2 had no performance estimates for background ops  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added detailed time estimates:
  - Initial MAAACKS Analysis: 5-10 seconds (backgrounded)
  - Initial Indie Blueprint Analysis: 8-15 seconds (backgrounded)
  - Incremental Updates: <500ms
  - Pattern Documentation: 1-3 seconds (backgrounded)
  - UI Impact: Zero (all background threaded)

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_PHASE_2_HOPS.md`

### **7. Phase 2 Error Recovery Missing** ✅
**Problem**: Phase 1 had comprehensive error recovery, Phase 2 had none  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added complete error recovery section matching Phase 1:
  - Template Analysis Failures: Skip & continue, fallback to manual
  - Scene Generation Failures: Transaction-based rollback, dry-run validation
  - GDScript Code Generation: GD linter pre-validation, code history
  - CTS Compliance Violations: Auto-fix suggestions, folder creation
  - Template Versioning Conflicts: Compatibility matrix, auto-migration
  - Performance Degradation: Chunked generation, timeout handling
  - Concurrency & Thread Safety: Message passing, cancellation tokens
  - State Management: Transaction logs, atomic operations

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_PHASE_2_HOPS.md`

## **🟢 Low Priority Issues - RESOLVED**

### **8. Signal Contract Versioning** ✅
**Problem**: No strategy for evolving signal contracts  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Documented in existing signal contract sections
- Versioning follows semantic versioning
- Deprecated signals maintained for 2 major versions
- Migration paths documented for breaking changes

**Files Modified**: Multiple (integrated into existing signal contract sections)

### **9. File Monitoring Throttling** ✅
**Problem**: FileSystemWatcher can overwhelm system on large projects  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added comprehensive throttling strategy:
  - **Debounce Window**: 500ms batch window
  - **Throttling**: Max 100 events/second
  - **Event Coalescing**: Multiple changes = 1 update
  - **Background Processing**: All ops backgrounded
  - **Incremental Updates**: Only changed files re-indexed
  - **Performance Budget**: <0.1ms per frame overhead
- Added `file_monitoring_throttled` signal

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_MASTER_PLAN.md`

### **10. Test Coverage Requirements** ✅
**Problem**: "All tests pass" was ambiguous  
**Solution Implemented**:
- Defined specific coverage requirements:
  - **100% signal contract validation** (mandatory)
  - **80% minimum code coverage** (public APIs)
  - **100% EventBus coverage** (critical infrastructure)
  - **100% branch coverage** for critical paths
  - **All error recovery paths** tested with failure injection
  - **All performance budgets** have benchmark tests

**Files Modified**: `BD_DEV_SUITE_MASTER_PLAN.md`
