## **THE SUNDERING: When God Died**

The Abrahamic God, Yahweh, is dead. The Sundering—the moment of divine death—has just occurred, and reality itself is still reeling from the cosmic wound. The ordered universe that Yahweh maintained has collapsed into chaotic fragments, where the laws of physics bend, time flows in eddies, and the barriers between Heaven, Hell, and Earth have shattered completely.

This is not a distant apocalypse spoken of in legends. This is the immediate aftermath. People are still picking up the pieces, still trying to understand what happened, still adapting to a world where the fundamental rules have changed. The detective's investigation begins in these first crucial days, when the truth might still be uncovered and the future is yet unwritten.

## **THE FRACTURED WORLD**

### **Geography of Chaos**
Most of the world has become **the Wastes**—shifting, unstable regions where pocket dimensions bleed through, carrying fragments of other times, places, and realities. A street might lead from 1940s noir cityscape to medieval ruins to futuristic wasteland, all within a few blocks. Natural storms of raw chaos sweep through these areas, relocating entire sections of reality without warning.

### **Safe Zones: Islands of Stability**
Scattered throughout the Wastes are **Safe Zones**—mysterious pockets of stability where the chaos storms cannot reach. These vary dramatically in size and character:

- **New Babylon**: A few miles across, mostly empty space that serves as the detective's base of operations
- **Human Enclaves**: Some controlled by well-equipped factions with munitions plants producing modern ammunition, others reduced to blackpowder rifles and scavenged materials
- **Angelic Strongholds**: Rigid, ordered settlements that mirror Heaven's former hierarchy
- **Demonic Territories**: Adaptable communities that thrive on the chaos at their borders

No one knows why these zones exist or what determines their boundaries. They simply are—and they represent the only hope for rebuilding civilization.

### **Time-Locked Anomalies**
Throughout the Wastes, certain locations become "time-locked"—frozen moments from the past or future that can be entered and explored. These might be ancient battlefields where companies of war-weary angels still fight, research facilities from futures that may never come to pass, or pivotal moments in history where crucial decisions were made. These anomalies are temporary, existing for only days or weeks before dissolving back into the chaos.

## **THE THREE RACES: Survivors of Divinity**

### **Angels: Order in Collapse**
Angels are rigid beings, bound by their nature to hierarchy and divine purpose. With Yahweh's death, they have lost their fundamental organizing principle, and the results are catastrophic:

- **The Broken Third**: Approximately one-third of all angels have gone completely mad with grief, becoming feral creatures that wander the Wastes. They are fundamentally broken and largely beyond salvation, though rare exceptions exist.
- **The Puritans**: Some angels have responded by becoming even more rigid, pursuing a puritanical war against all demonic forces regardless of alliances or circumstances.
- **The Adapters**: Other angels have learned to work symbiotically with human settlements, serving as protectors rather than rulers—though they struggle with this new role.

Angels still respond to divine authority, even when it comes from unexpected sources. The detective's Badge of the Morning Star (their former rank as Archangel) still causes angels to hesitate, providing crucial moments for negotiation—though it won't prevent hostility if tensions escalate.

**Combat Role**: Natural tanks with high defense and holy damage capabilities.

### **Demons: Chaos Embraced**
Demons have always been creatures of adaptation and rebellion, making them surprisingly well-suited to the post-Sundering world:

- **Legion Loyalists**: Some demons maintain the old military structure, continuing their eternal war against angels and taking human slaves.
- **Mercenary Companies**: Many demons have become specialists and mercenaries, offering their services to humans and even moderate angels.
- **Independent Operators**: The most adaptable have struck out entirely on their own, pursuing personal goals in the chaotic new world.

Demons respect individual achievement and pragmatic alliances. They're more likely to judge the detective by their actions than their badge, though Lucifer's endorsement carries significant weight.

**Combat Role**: High DPS specialists with infernal magic and rapid adaptation abilities.

### **Humans: Endless Adaptability**
Humanity's greatest strength has always been adaptability, and the Sundering has tested this to its limits:

- **Well-Equipped Factions**: Some human settlements have maintained or even improved their technological base, producing modern ammunition and advanced weaponry.
- **Scrapper Communities**: Other groups have regressed to simpler technologies—blackpowder weapons, jury-rigged equipment, and improvised solutions.
- **Survival Specialists**: Most humans have developed limited magical abilities focused on enhancement and improvement rather than creation—blessing bullets, sharpening blades, fortifying defenses.

Humans serve as the balanced middle ground, capable of working with both angels and demons while maintaining their own distinct identity and goals.

**Combat Role**: Balanced fighters with tactical flexibility and equipment specialization.

## **THE DETECTIVE: Investigator of the Ultimate Crime**

### **Background**
The detective was an ordinary city investigator before the Sundering—someone who dealt with mundane murders, theft, and corruption. Nothing in their background prepared them for investigating deicide, yet their dedication to truth and refusal to back down from even maddened Archangels impressed Lucifer enough to grant them leadership of New Babylon.

### **The Badge of the Morning Star**
This symbol of the detective's former rank as Archangel serves multiple functions:
- **Divine Authority**: Angels still recognize its legitimacy, providing opportunities for negotiation
- **Political Tool**: Demonstrates Lucifer's endorsement to demons and other factions
- **Personal Reminder**: A constant symbol of the detective's transformation from mundane investigator to cosmic authority

### **Lucifer's Gift: Functional Immortality**
Along with the badge, Lucifer granted the detective a form of functional immortality. No matter how catastrophic the detective's death—whether from combat, exploration mishaps, or factional conflicts—they will eventually revive back at New Babylon. However, this resurrection comes at a cost:

- **Time Lost**: Revival takes weeks to months depending on the circumstances of death and the detective's current spiritual state
- **Settlement Consequences**: New Babylon must survive without leadership during the revival period
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Critical events may occur while the detective is dead, creating information gaps and missed opportunities
- **Factional Relations**: Some groups may interpret repeated deaths as weakness or divine disfavor

This immortality serves both narrative and gameplay purposes—ensuring the detective can always continue their investigation while making death a meaningful setback rather than a game-ending failure.

### **Mission Parameters**
The detective's investigation operates under unique constraints:
- **Time Pressure**: Expeditions to anomalies can take weeks, during which New Babylon receives no direct supervision
- **Resource Management**: Exploration provides crucial supplies and recruits, but settlement development requires consistent presence
- **Political Navigation**: Every decision affects relationships with angels, demons, humans, and emerging pantheons

## **LUCIFER: The Philosopher-Rebel**

This is not the traditional Satan of Christian mythology, but rather a complex figure who embodies rebellion against tyranny and advocacy for free will:

### **Philosophy**
- **Free Will Advocate**: Opposes Yahweh's rigid control in favor of self-determination
- **Intellectual Rebel**: More philosopher than war leader, preferring to pursue enigmatic purposes
- **Spiritual Guide**: Still revered by many demons, though practical power rests with various princes and generals

### **Role in the Story**
Lucifer serves as the detective's patron and occasional advisor, but maintains a hands-off approach. They believe in the detective's ability to uncover the truth and make the right choices without constant guidance. Most importantly, Lucifer has granted the detective functional immortality—ensuring they can continue their investigation no matter what dangers they face, though each death carries significant consequences for New Babylon and the investigation itself.

## **FACTION DYNAMICS: The Politics of Survival**

### **Internal Tensions**
Every major group faces internal divisions:
- **Angels**: Puritans vs. Adapters vs. the Broken
- **Demons**: Legion Loyalists vs. Mercenaries vs. Independents  
- **Humans**: High-tech Enclaves vs. Scrapper Communities vs. Nomadic Survivors

### **Cross-Faction Relations**
- **Angel-Demon Cooperation**: Possible but always tense; provides unique synergies unavailable to mono-racial settlements
- **Human Mediation**: Humans often serve as bridges between angel and demon factions
- **Emerging Pantheons**: Other divine beings from different mythologies are beginning to manifest, adding new variables to an already complex political landscape

### **Settlement Composition Effects**
- **Mono-racial**: Less internal tension but limited capabilities
- **Multi-racial**: Higher tension but access to unique combinations and synergies
- **Balanced**: The detective must carefully manage relationships to prevent conflicts while maximizing benefits

## **THE AFFIX SYSTEM: Power in a Broken World**

### **Sources of Power**
With reality fractured, items and individuals can gain supernatural properties from multiple sources:
- **Chaos Mutations**: Random effects from exposure to the Wastes
- **Divine Remnants**: Blessed items still carry traces of Yahweh's power
- **Infernal Influence**: Demonic corruption or enhancement
- **Angelic Blessing**: Holy power channeled through righteous purpose
- **Crafted Enhancement**: Deliberate improvements applied by skilled practitioners

### **Types of Affixes**
- **Mundane**: Simple improvements like "Keen" (sharper blades) or "Powerful" (more effective ranged weapons)
- **Supernatural**: "Blessed," "Cursed," "Divine," "Tainted," "Corrupted"
- **Factional**: Items that respond differently to angels, demons, or humans
- **Personal**: Enhancements that grow with the user's experience and choices

## **CORE THEMES: Philosophy in Action**

### **Free Will vs. Divine Order**
The central philosophical conflict of the setting. With Yahweh dead, who has the right to impose order? How much freedom is too much? Can society function without some form of higher authority?

### **A Few Against the Dark**
Despite the grimdark setting, this is ultimately a story about hope. The detective and their allies represent the possibility that individuals can make a difference, that small communities can thrive, and that the future doesn't have to be defined by the past.

### **The Cost of Power**
Every advantage comes with tradeoffs. Angelic blessing provides holy damage but may alienate demons. Demonic allies offer unique capabilities but create tension with angels. High-tech equipment requires rare resources that could be used elsewhere.

### **Truth vs. Survival**
The detective's commitment to uncovering the truth about Yahweh's death sometimes conflicts with the immediate needs of New Babylon's survival. When do you stop investigating to defend your people? How much risk is acceptable in pursuit of answers?

## **VICTORY CONDITIONS: Multiple Paths Forward**

### **The Ultimate Investigation**
The primary questline involves discovering what happened to Yahweh and potentially gaining the power to remake the world according to the detective's vision. However, this is designed as an optional endgame rather than a mandatory conclusion.

### **Endless Exploration**
The game supports indefinite play focused on:
- **Settlement Development**: Building New Babylon into a thriving city
- **Factional Relations**: Navigating complex politics across multiple groups
- **Exploration**: Discovering new anomalies, resources, and allies
- **Personal Growth**: Developing the detective's capabilities and relationships

### **Multiple Endings**
The detective's choices throughout the game will determine not only how the investigation concludes, but what kind of world emerges from the chaos:
- **Restored Order**: Recreating something like the old divine hierarchy
- **Embraced Chaos**: Accepting the fractured reality as the new normal
- **Balanced Synthesis**: Finding a middle path between order and freedom
- **Personal Vision**: Imposing the detective's unique understanding of how the world should work

## **GAMEPLAY INTEGRATION: Story Through Mechanics**

### **Time as Currency**
Every action has temporal cost. Exploring distant anomalies means missing settlement events. Building major projects requires personal supervision. The detective must constantly balance immediate needs against long-term goals.

### **Relationship Consequences**
Faction relationships directly affect gameplay:
- **Angel Allies**: Provide blessed equipment and defensive bonuses
- **Demon Allies**: Offer unique knowledge and aggressive capabilities  
- **Human Allies**: Supply practical resources and balanced support
- **Mixed Groups**: Create tension but enable powerful synergies

### **Resource Scarcity**
New Babylon requires constant input to survive:
- **Military Supplies**: Steel, ammunition, weapons for the militia
- **Settlement Needs**: Food, medicine, building materials
- **Magical Resources**: Angelic relics, demonic artifacts, divine fragments
- **Population**: New colonists, both civilian and military

### **Procedural Challenges**
The affix system ensures that no two playthroughs are identical. Random equipment, variable faction spawns, and procedurally generated anomalies create endless replayability while maintaining narrative coherence.

### **Death and Resurrection**
The detective's functional immortality creates unique gameplay dynamics:
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Players can attempt dangerous expeditions knowing they'll eventually return, but must weigh the cost of lost time
- **Settlement Management**: New Babylon must be self-sufficient enough to survive leadership gaps
- **Strategic Death**: In extreme situations, voluntary death might be preferable to capture or corruption
- **Reputation Effects**: Frequent deaths may affect how factions perceive the detective's competence and divine favor

*"In the ashes of divinity, we write our own commandments. In the chaos of a broken world, we build our own order. The truth is out there, scattered across fragments of reality—and we will find it, no matter the cost."*
