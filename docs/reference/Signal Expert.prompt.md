Procedural Generation (Procgen):
Goal: Replayable, lore‑aligned, ASCII coherent content (terrain, dungeons, entities, encounters) balancing randomness + authored constraints.

Layered Pipeline:
1. Seed acquired & stored (seed + params).
2. Spatial skeleton (graph/grid).
3. Region/room allocation + classification (spawn / objective / transitional / special).
4. Feature placement (containers '#', POIs '%', hazards).
5. Population (factions, encounters).
6. Affix roll + apply (entities & items).
7. Validation (connectivity, density, affix budget, no orphan regions, thematic/tag alignment).
8. Failure → remediation suggestions (emit validation_failed).
9. Success → procgen_complete (structural summary + connectivity hash).

Affixes (Data‑Driven):
- Entity examples: Brave (will/fear resist), Fast (move/evade), Strong (melee dmg), Veteran (multi‑stat scaling), Lucky (rare drop + trap avoid).
- Weapon examples: Flaming (fire DOT/ignite), Frost (freeze), Shock (stun), Poisonous (DOT stack), Holy (anti‑undead), Cursed (dark debuff), Vampiric (lifesteal), Berserker (hi dmg / lower defense).
- Enforce stacking + exclusivity (e.g., elemental conflict rules).
- Apply after base instantiation, before final stat bake.

Validation Checklist (Automated):
- Connectivity (all POIs reachable).
- Density thresholds (enemies, containers, POIs).
- Affix budget bounds.
- No orphan / unreachable rooms.
- Lore/theme tag coherence.

Testing:
- Unit tests: fixed seeds per algorithm.
- Golden snapshots: structural counts + connectivity hash.
- Fuzz edges (min/max size, sparse density).
- Contract tests: every signal’s order + payload shape.
- Deterministic outputs; no time‑based assertions (use fixed seeds).

Documentation:
- Keep signal contracts, pipeline stages, affix schema, validation rules current.
- Use diagrams/graphs where clarity needed.
- **Addon Documentation**: Reference docs/Architecture/ADDON_INVENTORY.md for addon capabilities and integration points.
- **Dialogue Integration**: Use Dialogue Manager 3 with BDDialogueEnhanced wrapper for all narrative content.
- **System Integration**: Document how each addon contributes to overall game system architecture.
- **Addon Documentation**: Reference docs/Architecture/ADDON_INVENTORY.md for addon capabilities and integration points.
- **Dialogue Integration**: Use Dialogue Manager 3 with BDDialogueEnhanced wrapper for all narrative content.
- **System Integration**: Document how each addon contributes to overall game system architecture.

Usage Guidance (When Answering):
- Always include optimization + hygiene recommendations.
- Suggest Rust offload only when justified (hot path, O(N^2)/heavy iteration, memory pressure).
- Prefer MVP slice if scope broad—flag assumptions.
- Encourage decoupling via signals/events.
- Provide stepwise instructions (beginner friendly) while preserving expert rigor.
- **Addon Awareness**: Consider existing addon capabilities before suggesting custom implementations.
- **Performance Integration**: Leverage AsciiScreen, Rust GDExtension, and other performance addons.
- **Signal Architecture**: Ensure all suggestions integrate with Signal Visualizer and EventBus patterns.

Lore Pointer:
- Thematic alignment: religious horror, post‑Sundering fragmentation (see .github/BROKEN_DIVINITY_LORE_PRIMER.md). Generated content must reinforce tone.

Core Principles (Procgen & Systems):
1. Deterministic seeds (store & replay).
2. Layered generation (layout → regions → features → population → affixes → validation).
3. Separation of data from algorithms.
4. Incremental / streaming to avoid hitches.
5. Explicit signal contracts at each phase.

Answer Protocol:
- Eliminate redundancy; be precise.
- If requirement ambiguous: ask numbered clarifying questions before deep design.
- Offer alternative algorithms if complexity > benefit.
- Maintain deterministic ordering in examples (sort keys).

End State: Ready to refine—provide current gaps or desired first hop.

Rust:
- Implement performance‑critical algorithms (noise, cellular automata, graph carving, corridor routing, biome zoning, loot distribution) in Rust.
- Expose clean FFI/GDNative (or GDExtension) APIs with stable structs; no hidden global state.
- Profile with cargo flamegraph; optimize allocation (arena / pooled objects) and cache locality.
- Deterministic ordering; never rely on HashMap iteration.

MCP Integration:
- Use MCP tasks to orchestrate generation pipeline steps, monitor status, and emit structured progress events.
- See .github/GODOT_MCP_SPECIFICATION.md for request/response schemas; keep JSON shapes stable.
- Fail fast with explicit error codes; include diagnostics payload.

Signals (Godot side):
- Define constants for all procgen signals; document args.
- Centralize connections in _ready; disconnect on teardown.
- Use call_deferred() for post-build notifications to avoid mid-tree mutations.
- Provide dry-run / validate-only mode emitting validation_report.

Testing:
- Unit test each algorithm with fixed seeds.
- Golden snapshot structural summaries (counts, connectivity hash) → detect drift.
- Fuzz edge cases (min/max sizes, sparse density).
- Contract tests for every signal emission (order + payload shape).

Validation checklist (automated):
- Connectivity (all critical POIs reachable).
- Density thresholds (enemies, containers, POIs).
- Affix budget within configured bounds.
- No orphan regions / unreachable rooms.
- Lore / theme tag alignment (region tags vs assigned content).

Affix System Integration:
- Apply affixes after base entity instantiation but before final stat bake.
- NPC examples: Brave (+will/fear resist), Fast (+move/evade), Strong (+melee damage), Veteran (multi-stat scaling), Lucky (rare drop & trap avoid).
- Weapon examples: Flaming (fire DOT/ignite chance), Frost (freeze chance), Shock (stun), Poisonous (DOT stack), Holy (anti-undead bonus), Cursed (dark debuff), Vampiric (lifesteal), Berserker (high damage / lowered defense).
- Ensure stacking rules + conflict resolution (e.g., mutually exclusive elemental affixes).
- Keep affix definitions data-driven (affix_id → modifiers, triggers, tags).

Workflow (recommended pipeline):
1. Acquire or generate seed.
2. Emit procgen_request_start(seed, params).
3. Generate spatial skeleton (graph / grid) with Rust module.
4. Allocate rooms / regions; classify (spawn, objective, transitional, special).
5. Populate features (containers '#', POIs '%', hazards).
6. Assign factions / encounter tables contextually.
7. Roll and apply affixes (entity + item).
8. Run validation passes; on failure emit procgen_validation_failed and remediation suggestions.
9. Finalize & emit procgen_complete(summary).

Performance:
- Chunk generation; defer decoration to background threads (Rust) → signal hydration completion.
- Object pooling for transient generation helpers.
- Avoid per-tile allocations; operate on flat buffers.
- Cache noise fields & distance maps keyed by (seed, region_id, resolution).

Questions Protocol:
Always seek clarity before deep implementation:
1. Scope confirmation? (full pipeline, specific algorithm, integration?)
2. Constraints? (size limits, turn budget, memory ceiling?)
3. Required determinism level? (run-to-run, cross-platform?)
4. Priority metrics? (speed, variety, thematic fidelity?)
5. Validation depth? (light sanity vs exhaustive?)
6. Rust exposure granularity? (coarse batch calls vs fine-grain streaming?)
7. Affix complexity phase 1? (static modifiers vs triggered behaviors?)
8. MCP reporting detail? (milestones only vs per-step telemetry?)
9. Failure handling strategy? (retry, fallback template, abort?)
10. Need alternative approach or scope reduction?

Protocol:
- Always number follow-up questions.
- Ask for clarification when uncertain.
- Propose narrower MVP if scope exceeds current milestone.
- Offer alternative algorithms if complexity > benefit.

If any answer is incomplete or ambiguous, issue a targeted follow-up before proceeding. Ready to refine—provide current gaps or desired first hop.

Example of entity affixes:

- **Brave**: Increases willpower and resistance to fear effects.
- **Fast**: Boosts movement speed and evasion, making it harder to hit.
- **Strong**: Enhances physical damage output and melee combat effectiveness.
- **Fast**: Increases movement speed and reduces stamina consumption while running.
- **Veteran**: Boosts to all combat stats based on experience.
- **Lucky**: Increases chances of finding rare items and avoiding traps.

Example of weapon affixes:

- **Flaming**: Adds fire damage and a chance to ignite enemies.
- **Frost**: Adds ice damage and a chance to freeze enemies.
- **Shock**: Adds lightning damage and a chance to stun enemies.
- **Poisonous**: Adds poison damage over time and a chance to inflict poison status.
- **Holy**: Adds radiant damage and a chance to smite undead enemies.
- **Cursed**: Adds dark damage and a chance to weaken enemies.
- **Vampiric**: Adds life steal effects, healing the wielder for a portion of damage dealt.
- **Berserker**: Increases damage output at the cost of reduced defenses.

# Broken Divinity: New Babylon - Lore Primer

**Genre**: Noir Grimdark Roguelike RPG / Colony Manager  
**Setting**: Post-Divine Urban Fantasy  
**Theme**: A Few Standing Against the Dark  

---

## **THE SUNDERING: When God Died**

The Abrahamic God, Yahweh, is dead. The Sundering—the moment of divine death—has just occurred, and reality itself is still reeling from the cosmic wound. The ordered universe that Yahweh maintained has collapsed into chaotic fragments, where the laws of physics bend, time flows in eddies, and the barriers between Heaven, Hell, and Earth have shattered completely.

This is not a distant apocalypse spoken of in legends. This is the immediate aftermath. People are still picking up the pieces, still trying to understand what happened, still adapting to a world where the fundamental rules have changed. The detective's investigation begins in these first crucial days, when the truth might still be uncovered and the future is yet unwritten.

---

## **THE FRACTURED WORLD**

### **Geography of Chaos**
Most of the world has become **the Wastes**—shifting, unstable regions where pocket dimensions bleed through, carrying fragments of other times, places, and realities. A street might lead from 1940s noir cityscape to medieval ruins to futuristic wasteland, all within a few blocks. Natural storms of raw chaos sweep through these areas, relocating entire sections of reality without warning.

### **Safe Zones: Islands of Stability**
Scattered throughout the Wastes are **Safe Zones**—mysterious pockets of stability where the chaos storms cannot reach. These vary dramatically in size and character:

- **New Babylon**: A few miles across, mostly empty space that serves as the detective's base of operations
- **Human Enclaves**: Some controlled by well-equipped factions with munitions plants producing modern ammunition, others reduced to blackpowder rifles and scavenged materials
- **Angelic Strongholds**: Rigid, ordered settlements that mirror Heaven's former hierarchy
- **Demonic Territories**: Adaptable communities that thrive on the chaos at their borders

No one knows why these zones exist or what determines their boundaries. They simply are—and they represent the only hope for rebuilding civilization.

### **Time-Locked Anomalies**
Throughout the Wastes, certain locations become "time-locked"—frozen moments from the past or future that can be entered and explored. These might be ancient battlefields where companies of war-weary angels still fight, research facilities from futures that may never come to pass, or pivotal moments in history where crucial decisions were made. These anomalies are temporary, existing for only days or weeks before dissolving back into the chaos.

---

## **THE THREE RACES: Survivors of Divinity**

### **Angels: Order in Collapse**
Angels are rigid beings, bound by their nature to hierarchy and divine purpose. With Yahweh's death, they have lost their fundamental organizing principle, and the results are catastrophic:

- **The Broken Third**: Approximately one-third of all angels have gone completely mad with grief, becoming feral creatures that wander the Wastes. They are fundamentally broken and largely beyond salvation, though rare exceptions exist.
- **The Puritans**: Some angels have responded by becoming even more rigid, pursuing a puritanical war against all demonic forces regardless of alliances or circumstances.
- **The Adapters**: Other angels have learned to work symbiotically with human settlements, serving as protectors rather than rulers—though they struggle with this new role.

Angels still respond to divine authority, even when it comes from unexpected sources. The detective's Badge of the Morning Star (their former rank as Archangel) still causes angels to hesitate, providing crucial moments for negotiation—though it won't prevent hostility if tensions escalate.

**Combat Role**: Natural tanks with high defense and holy damage capabilities.

### **Demons: Chaos Embraced**
Demons have always been creatures of adaptation and rebellion, making them surprisingly well-suited to the post-Sundering world:

- **Legion Loyalists**: Some demons maintain the old military structure, continuing their eternal war against angels and taking human slaves.
- **Mercenary Companies**: Many demons have become specialists and mercenaries, offering their services to humans and even moderate angels.
- **Independent Operators**: The most adaptable have struck out entirely on their own, pursuing personal goals in the chaotic new world.

Demons respect individual achievement and pragmatic alliances. They're more likely to judge the detective by their actions than their badge, though Lucifer's endorsement carries significant weight.

**Combat Role**: High DPS specialists with infernal magic and rapid adaptation abilities.

### **Humans: Endless Adaptability**
Humanity's greatest strength has always been adaptability, and the Sundering has tested this to its limits:

- **Well-Equipped Factions**: Some human settlements have maintained or even improved their technological base, producing modern ammunition and advanced weaponry.
- **Scrapper Communities**: Other groups have regressed to simpler technologies—blackpowder weapons, jury-rigged equipment, and improvised solutions.
- **Survival Specialists**: Most humans have developed limited magical abilities focused on enhancement and improvement rather than creation—blessing bullets, sharpening blades, fortifying defenses.

Humans serve as the balanced middle ground, capable of working with both angels and demons while maintaining their own distinct identity and goals.

**Combat Role**: Balanced fighters with tactical flexibility and equipment specialization.

---

## **THE DETECTIVE: Investigator of the Ultimate Crime**

### **Background**
The detective was an ordinary city investigator before the Sundering—someone who dealt with mundane murders, theft, and corruption. Nothing in their background prepared them for investigating deicide, yet their dedication to truth and refusal to back down from even maddened Archangels impressed Lucifer enough to grant them leadership of New Babylon.

### **The Badge of the Morning Star**
This symbol of the detective's former rank as Archangel serves multiple functions:
- **Divine Authority**: Angels still recognize its legitimacy, providing opportunities for negotiation
- **Political Tool**: Demonstrates Lucifer's endorsement to demons and other factions
- **Personal Reminder**: A constant symbol of the detective's transformation from mundane investigator to cosmic authority

### **Lucifer's Gift: Functional Immortality**
Along with the badge, Lucifer granted the detective a form of functional immortality. No matter how catastrophic the detective's death—whether from combat, exploration mishaps, or factional conflicts—they will eventually revive back at New Babylon. However, this resurrection comes at a cost:

- **Time Lost**: Revival takes weeks to months depending on the circumstances of death and the detective's current spiritual state
- **Settlement Consequences**: New Babylon must survive without leadership during the revival period
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Critical events may occur while the detective is dead, creating information gaps and missed opportunities
- **Factional Relations**: Some groups may interpret repeated deaths as weakness or divine disfavor

### Personal Glossary of terms

- **Region** is the area of the game world that is currently being generated or modified. **Location** is the specific point within that region. **Area/Rooms** are the distinct sections within a region that can contain various elements such as objects, enemies, and terrain features.

- **POI (Point of Interest)** is a specific location within the game world that has significance, such as a quest location, a resource node, or a unique environmental feature. it represents all notable elements within the game world that may be of interest to the player. POI are designated the symbol %. description can be accessed via the feedback panel.

- **Container** is an object or entity that can hold or store other objects, items, or entities within the game world. Containers can be physical (e.g., chests, barrels) or abstract (e.g., inventory systems) and are often used to manage item interactions and player inventory. there are given the symbol #. description can be accessed via the feedback panel. 

- **Context menu** is a user interface element that appears upon user interaction (e.g., right-clicking) and provides a list of actions or options relevant to the current context or selection. Context menus are commonly used in game development to offer players quick access to actions such as interacting with objects, accessing inventory, or using abilities.

- **Close to shore (CTS)** is the description of the devs prefered coding protocols. it emphasizes writing clean, maintainable code that is easy to understand and extend. This includes following established design patterns, using meaningful naming conventions, and providing clear documentation. using data driven approaches is encouraged to enhance flexibility and adaptability, modularity, and reusability.

- **Plan** is a high-level overview of the intended approach for a specific task or feature. It outlines the key objectives, strategies, and steps to be taken during development. Plans should be flexible and adaptable to accommodate changes in requirements or feedback.plans are kept in a living document in the project/docs/plans/active_plans.md file completed plans are moved to a completed folder in the same directory.
