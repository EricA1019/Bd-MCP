## File System Monitoring Implementation

### EditorFileSystem Integration
**Purpose**: Leverage Godot's built-in file monitoring system  
**Signals Used**:
- `filesystem_changed()` - Broad file system changes
- `resources_reimported(resources)` - Specific resource updates

**Implementation**:
```gdscript
var editor_file_system = EditorInterface.get_resource_filesystem()
editor_file_system.filesystem_changed.connect(_on_filesystem_changed)
editor_file_system.resources_reimported.connect(_on_resources_reimported)
```

**Status**: Implemented ✅

### File Change Detection Flow
1. EditorFileSystem emits `filesystem_changed` signal
2. FileWatcher scans project directory recursively
3. File status checked against cached metadata (timestamp)
4. Changes queued in `_pending_changes` dictionary
5. Debounce timer started/restarted
6. After timeout, all pending changes processed
7. Appropriate signals emitted (file_added, file_modified, file_deleted)

**Status**: Implemented ✅

### Debouncing Strategy
**Purpose**: Prevent signal spam during bulk operations  
**Mechanism**: Timer-based batching
- Single-shot Timer with configurable wait time
- Timer reset on each new change
- Changes batch-processed on timeout
- Default 100ms delay (minimum 50ms)

**Benefits**:
- Reduces signal noise during file imports
- Groups related changes together
- Maintains responsiveness (<100ms)
- Configurable for different workflows

**Status**: Implemented ✅

### File Type Categorization
**Method**: Extension-based mapping  
**Categories** (12 total):
- script (.gd, .gdscript)
- scene (.tscn, .scn)
- resource (.tres, .res)
- config (.json, .cfg, .xml, .yaml, .yml)
- document (.md, .txt, .rst, .pdf)
- shader (.gdshader, .shader, .glsl, .hlsl)
- image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .svg, .webp)
- audio (.wav, .ogg, .mp3, .flac)
- model (.gltf, .glb, .obj, .fbx, .dae)
- font (.ttf, .otf, .woff, .woff2)
- data (.csv, .tsv, .sqlite, .db)
- animation (.anim, .animtree)

**Fallback**: unknown (for unrecognized extensions)

**Status**: Implemented ✅

## Explicit Non-Goals (Deferred to Later Hops)

### Deferred to Hop 1.2b (Project Index & Search)
- ❌ Full project indexing system
- ❌ File content parsing
- ❌ Search functionality
- ❌ Search result ranking
- ❌ Index persistence

### Deferred to Hop 1.2c (Performance & Integration)
- ❌ Git integration
- ❌ Content-based file analysis
- ❌ Advanced performance optimization
- ❌ Rust-based file scanning
- ❌ Background thread processing

### Scope Clarity
Hop 1.2a focuses **exclusively** on:
- Real-time file change detection
- Signal-based event notification
- Basic file categorization
- Debounced event batching

**All indexing, search, and analysis features are explicitly out of scope for this hop.**

---

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **EditorFileSystem Dependency**
   - FileWatcher requires EditorInterface
   - Not functional in standalone game builds
   - Editor-only monitoring capability

2. **Basic Categorization**
   - Extension-based only, no content analysis
   - No MIME type detection
   - No custom category definitions (yet)

3. **Limited Filtering**
   - Ignore patterns defined but not fully implemented
   - No per-directory watch rules
   - No file size filters

4. **Performance Scaling**
   - Recursive scanning on each filesystem_changed
   - No incremental updates
   - Large projects may see delays

### Planned Improvements (Future Hops)

1. **Hop 1.2b Enhancements**
   - Incremental index updates
   - Smart caching of file metadata
   - Filtered scanning based on watch rules

2. **Hop 1.2c Optimizations**
   - Rust-based file scanning for large projects
   - Background thread processing
   - Smarter change detection algorithms

3. **Future Phase Additions**
   - Content-based file classification
   - Git status integration
   - Custom watch rules per folder
   - File size and complexity metrics

---

## Regression Prevention

### Changes That Could Break Hop 1.2a
⚠️ **DO NOT**:
- Modify file system signal signatures without updating SIGNAL_CONTRACTS.md
- Change FileWatcher initialization order in plugin.gd
- Remove or rename file_types.json without migration
- Modify debounce timer without testing batching behavior
- Change EditorFileSystem signal connections

✅ **SAFE TO**:
- Add new file type categories to file_types.json
- Add new file system signals (maintain backward compatibility)
- Enhance file categorization logic
- Add filtering and watch rules
- Optimize file scanning performance

### Validation Before Committing Changes
1. Run all GUT tests: `tests/test_file_watcher.gd`
2. Verify plugin initializes with FileWatcher
3. Check file change detection in editor
4. Confirm signal emissions in Signal Visualizer
5. Validate performance budgets still met (<100ms detection)
6. Update SIGNAL_CONTRACTS.md if signals changed
7. Verify all Hop 1.1 tests still pass (regression check)

---

## Integration Testing

### Manual Verification Steps
1. **Enable Plugin**
   - Open Godot editor
   - Navigate to Project > Project Settings > Plugins
   - Enable "Broken Divinity DevTools"
   - Verify no errors in Output console
   - Check "BD DevTools" dock appears

2. **Create Test File**
   - Create new GDScript file: `test_monitoring.gd`
   - Verify file_added signal emitted (check logs)
   - File should be categorized as "script"

3. **Modify Test File**
   - Edit and save `test_monitoring.gd`
   - Verify file_modified signal emitted
   - Timestamp should update

4. **Delete Test File**
   - Delete `test_monitoring.gd`
   - Verify file_deleted signal emitted
   - File removed from watched paths

5. **Bulk Import**
   - Import multiple files at once
   - Verify debouncing (not 1 signal per file)
   - Check batched emissions after 100ms

6. **Performance Check**
   - Check initialization time in logs (<2ms)
   - Monitor file change detection latency (<100ms)
   - Verify no performance warnings
